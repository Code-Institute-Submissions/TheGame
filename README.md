# TheGame
### The Second Milestone project by Stan Kaczorkiewicz

This is my second project as part of the Software Development Course by Code Institute.
Main first idea regarding to the Milestone project was totally different. 
I started creating website, thet was meant to present beauty of Tatry Mountains to English-speaking world 
(and to show some of my great pictures, taken there). During the process of creations, however, 
I've noticed that my JavaScript understanding wasn't good enough to perform that task.
After the moment of panic, when I consiedered to abadon whole course, if I can't learn anything here,
I started new project, which I have a pleasure to present here.

The main purpose of TheGame, from my perspective, was to help me to understand how JavaScript works.
I'm still  far away from being perfect at it, but I can report that mission was fulfilled, 
and I'm in different place, than I was a week ago.
As the date of my submission was coming closer, I worked under strong time pressure.
I'm quite proud of what I was able to do in such a short time, while still doing my full-time job as a key worker.
Also, my first idea of project, stands behind the third social media link, that lead user to my fiancee Pinterest page.
I decided to leave it here, as it looks much nicer with three links, and I dont use enough social-media to have three links on myself.
The reason behind TheGame from the user perspective, wes to have a bit of mental excersize, 
or just some entertainment while sitting home because of the lockdown.

##UX

While creating TheGame, I wanted to make interactive, intuitive, user-friendly website,
that will entertain users in this difficult time.
To make it intuitive, I used Bootstrap tools, and 
I choose light-blue colors, as it has positive and calming conotations.

My first Idea of the look of my page is [here](assets/images/firstPage.jpg) and [here](assets/images/secondPage.png).
I've decided it will be nicer to keep it all the time in 3-columns order,
also the first page looks better, in my opinion, with three rows instead of two, as it was in my first Idea.

Difficulty of the game is increased with every level
