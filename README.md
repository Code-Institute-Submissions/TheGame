# *TheGame*
### The Second Milestone project by Stan Kaczorkiewicz

This is my second project as part of the Software Development Course by **Code Institute**.
Main first idea regarding to the Milestone project was totally different. 
I started creating website, thet was meant to present beauty of Tatry Mountains to English-speaking world 
(and to show some of my great pictures, taken there). During the process of creations, however, 
I've noticed that my JavaScript understanding wasn't good enough to perform that task.
After the moment of panic, when I consiedered to abadon whole course, if I can't learn anything here,
I started new project, which I have a pleasure to present here.

The main purpose of TheGame, from my perspective, was to help me to understand how JavaScript works.
I'm still  far away from being perfect at it, but I can report that mission was fulfilled, 
and I'm in different place, than I was a week ago.
As the date of my submission was coming closer, I worked under strong time pressure.
I'm quite proud of what I was able to do in such a short time, while still doing my full-time job as a key worker.
Also, my first idea of project, stands behind the third social media link, that lead user to my fiancee Pinterest page.
I decided to leave it here, as it looks much nicer with three links, and I dont use enough social-media to have three links on myself.
The reason behind TheGame from the user perspective, wes to have a bit of mental excersize, 
or just some entertainment while sitting home because of the lockdown.

## UX

While creating *TheGame*, I wanted to make interactive, intuitive, user-friendly website,
that will entertain users in this difficult time.To make it intuitive, I used Bootstrap tools, and 
I choose light-blue colors, as it has positive and calming conotations.

My first idea of the look of *TheGame* can be seen [here](assets/images/firstPage.jpg) and [here](assets/images/secondPage.png).
Then I've decided it will be nicer to keep it all the time in 3-columns order,
also the first page looks better, in my opinion, with three rows instead of two, as it was firstly.

I identified a user as a random person from long list of my Facebook friends.
As an effect of that, I kept all texts on the website to the minimum, 
as it's designed to be useful for people raised in various cultures and speaking various languages.
Also the colors are easy to identify, and most of the game is self-explaining.

# Features

## Existing Features:

### Navigation 
Based on the tools provided by bootstrap, provides user with a chanse to come back 
to the home page at any stage, or to contact page, to be in touch with me if they wish. 
Navigation also provides an access to every other level, if user will "unclick" the "disabled" class in it.
I was using that option while creating the website and found it very useful, so I decided to leave it for future use. 

### Footer with social links
Fake quotes are intended to make users day a little bit brighter and to turn their attention away from our current situation on the world.
Social links will allow user to contact me on facebook, see my photos on Instagram,
or to see some beautiful pictures of __*Tatry mountains*__ on my miss Pinterest, as I mentioned above.

### Three levels of the Game
Will provide user with an occasion to kill some time, while self- isolating.
Increasing level of difficulty is making *TheGame* more attractive (at least in my opinion).

### Time counting function
This is the idea that I implemented as the last one, after comments made by my friend.
He said he would like to know that and I found it as a really good feature, that adds some element of competition to it.

### Tiles shifting their position
It makes TheGame a bit more challenging for players on the large screen, but also easier to scroll through 
for mobile players (as I'm assuming most people are using their Facebook on smartphones, 
so this is where they will use *TheGame* as well, if I will make it public).
